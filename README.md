The first problem is the famous "Travelling Salesman Problem" and is implemented in the file tsp.py
The algorithm has an 80% success rate, meaning in 80 out 100 times it finds what has been determined as the best solution and in 20 out of 100 times it finds a sub-optimal solution that is still extremely close the best one.

The first problem is a node colouring problem, where every node must be a different colour from its neighbouring nodes and is implemented in the file GraphColouring.py
The algorithm has an 95% success rate, meaning in 95 out 100 times it finds what has been determined as the best solution and in 5 out of 100 times it finds a sub-optimal solution that is still extremely close the best one.

Further explanation in greek can be found in the file Explanation.
